Hamster can be found packaged in most distributions. The instructions below
are for installing from sources for testing and development purposes.

The instructions are mix between Gnome 2 and Gnome 3, so, errm, just bear with
us.

h1. Dependencies

Debian-based: @apt-get install git-core gettext intltool gnome-control-center-dev@
RPM-based: @yum install git-core gettext intltool gnome-control-center-dev@

h1. Installing

./waf configure build --prefix=/usr
sudo ./waf install

Now restart your panels/dockies and you should be able to add hamster to your panel!

*Note*: reason for the /usr prefix is that the applet server is not looking into the default prefix (which is /usr/local).
