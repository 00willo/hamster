<title>Backup</title>

<p>
    Activities are stored in an SQLite database, located at
    <file>~/.local/share/hamster-time-tracker/hamster.db</file>.
    The file can be backed up and restored on the go.
    The application will reload the data automatically after a short while.
</p>
<note style="info">
    <p>
        For viewing contents of the database we can suggest using the
        <link href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/"><app>DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S)</app></link>.

    <p>
        Previously the database was stored in
        <file>~/.local/share/hamster-applet/hamster.db</file>.
        Recent versions of Hamster migrate this file to the new location
        and the old file can be safely removed afterwards if desired.
