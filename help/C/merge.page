<title>Splitting activities</title>

<p>
    <app>Time Tracker</app> does its best to avoid overlaps in activities.
    If you create an activity whose start and end time both lie within an
    existing activity, the existing activity will be split into two. In
    other cases of overlapping, the previous entries will be shrunk.

        Merging can become handy when entering information for the whole
        day. Start by entering the first activity with only a start time
        (i.e. activity "in progress"). For the next activity again set just
        the start time. Observe how the end time of the previous activity
        gets adjusted to the start time of the new one. Repeat the process
        until happy!
