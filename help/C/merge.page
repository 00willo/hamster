<title>Splitting activities</title>

<p>
    <app>Time Tracker</app> does its best to avoid overlaps in activities.
    If you create an activity in the middle of an existing activity, the former
    will be split into two. In other cases of overlapping, the previous entries
    will be shrunk.

<note style="bug">
    <title>Former activity not split</title>
    <p>
        The former activity is not "split into two" actually,
        but merely shortened to end when the new activity starts.
        Reported as <link href="https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster/issues/396">issue 396</link>.

        Merging can become handy when entering information for the whole
        day. Start by entering the first activity and select the "in progress"
        check box for the end time. For the next activity again set just the
        start time and mark it as ongoing. Observe how the end time of the
        previous activity gets adjusted to the start time of the new one.
        Repeat the process until happy!
